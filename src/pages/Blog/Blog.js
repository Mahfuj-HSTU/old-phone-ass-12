                <p>The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add methods and properties in objects. It is a method by which an object can inherit the properties and methods of another object. Traditionally, in order to get and set the [[Prototype]] of an object, we use Object.getPrototypeOf and Object.setPrototypeOf. Nowadays, in modern language, it is being set using __proto__.

                <p>Unit testing, a testing technique using which individual modules are tested to determine if there are any issues by the developer himself.</p>
                <p>when you write test you take the perspective of the one that will consume your code. It forces you to have an holistic approach of the behavior to implement. This way ambiguities you get from requirements become obvious and are immediately taken account when code is written the first time.</p>

                <h3 className='text-2xl mb-2'> React vs. Angular vs. Vue</h3>
                <p>React is a UI library, Angular is a fully-fledged front-end framework, while Vue.js is a progressive framework. <br />They can be used almost interchangeably to build front-end applications, but theyâ€™re not 100 percent the same, so it makes sense to compare them and understand their differences. <br />Each framework is component-based and allows the rapid creation of UI features. </p>
